# PCB-Visual-Inspection-on-Raspberry-Pi
[C#][UWP] PCB Visual Inspection Device based on Raspberry Pi 3B (Windows IoT)


# Idea:
My idea was born during my internship at LACROIX Electronics. It's a electronics manufacturer company which produces parts for Bosch, VALEO, etc. One of the biggest devices there was SMT Wave Soldering Machine which solders components like resistors, capacitors, chips or LEDs. At each step of soldering there were a minicomputers with normal and IR cameras which have been doing visual inspection of PCBs. The algorithm was checking if the components are not missing or to much shifted. Considering the experience I've gained there and my knowledge and intrest in programming, I proposed my BSc thesis to design, build and program simplier version of that device (without soldering) which performs a visual inspection of PCBs.
