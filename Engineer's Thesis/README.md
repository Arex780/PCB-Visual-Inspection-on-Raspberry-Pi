# Review by dr Wojciech Śleszyński (reviewer)

## 1. Substantive assessment of diploma:

###### 1.a Aim of diploma:
The aim of the engineer's thesis is to design and implement an image capture and processing device based on the Raspberry Pi platform. The device will perform a simple algorithm of visual inspection of printed circuit boards.

###### 1.b Character of diploma:
Development of a computer program.

###### 1.c Degree of accomplishment of aim of diploma and correctness of problem-solving:
The aim of the engineer's thesis has been fully achieved. As a part of his project, the student designed and constructed a test bench for the vision inspection of printed circuit boards using a Raspberry Pi 3B single board computer, a webcam, two LEDs and a LCD touchscreen. The basic functionality of the proposed system has been positively verified through laboratory tests, the system allows to distinguish the differences between the tested and reference printed circuit boards.

###### 1.d Efficiency of use of specialist tools and methods for a given field of study:
The student has mastered the ability to program in C# language very well and has a very good knowledge of the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 programming environment. Skills related to the application of digital image processing methods go beyond the study program.

###### 1.e Evaluation of significance of solution/results obtained:
The results obtained by the student can be used in the didactic activity carried out at the Faculty of Electrical and Control Engneering, and the developed system of visual inspection of PCBs can be further improved by the Faculty students. The device developed by the student is not an innovative solution, but it may be a good starting point for further software development and commercialization of the obtained results.

## 2. Formal assessment of diploma:

###### 2.a Structure of diploma:
The structure of the engineer's thesis is correct and in accordance with the university guidelines. The division into chapters is appropriate and compatible with the project's objectives. The thesis consists of six chapters and four attachments which contain the microcontroller program code. The attached CD contains the document in DOCX and PDF format and a number of additional materials, including a video showing how the program works.

###### 2.b Way of describing subject of diploma:
In terms of language, the work is on a very good level. The terminology used in the work is correct. Spelling and punctuation do not raise any objections, only a few grammatical errors were noticed. The editorial requirements were met to a large extent.

###### 2.c Relevance of choice of literature:
The literature list includes eighteen items, the sources have been selected and used correctly to a large extent. Three books from the literature inventory, one article, one lecture and one recommendation from an international organisation concern image processing and image recognition; one book and one website refer to programming in C#. The other sources in the form of electronic documents are mostly technical documentation of devices and software used in the engineer's thesis. Bibliographic descriptions of electronic documents are not fully correct.

## 3. Summary:

###### 3.a Strengths and weaknesses of diploma: 
The unquestionable advantage of the thesis is the software, made at an above-average level, and experimental verification of the designed vision inspection device.

###### 3.b Other comments:
Wrong terminology used on page 8.

###### 3.c Final assessment of diploma (on a scale of 2-5): 
5.0
